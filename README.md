This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the nutritional content of various menu items at McDonalds. The dataset includes detailed information on the calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, and other key nutrients for a wide range of category.
The goal of this analysis is to provide valuable insights that can benefit both the restaurant's customers and the organization itself. By understanding the nutritional profiles of the menu offerings, customers can make informed choices that align with their dietary preferences and health goals. For the restaurant, this analysis can guide menu development strategies, allowing them to introduce healthier options and cater to diverse nutritional needs.
Through a detailed examination of the data, the project will identify the menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts, as well as determine the average nutritional content across the popular menu categories. This information can empower customers to make more health-conscious decisions and enable the restaurant to enhance its menu offerings to better serve its customer base.
